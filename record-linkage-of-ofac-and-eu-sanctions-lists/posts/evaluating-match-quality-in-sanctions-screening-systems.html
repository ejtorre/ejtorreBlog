<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
In sanctions screening, building a matching system is only half the problem. The other half — often underestimated — is evaluating whether the system behaves correctly under real operational conditions.
</p>

<p>
A matching algorithm that appears effective in isolation may produce unacceptable false positives, miss sanctioned entities, or behave unpredictably when thresholds change. For compliance teams, evaluation is therefore not an academic exercise — it directly impacts regulatory exposure and operational workload.
</p>

<p>
This article establishes a practical framework for evaluating entity matching systems in sanctions screening. The goal is to move from subjective impressions (“the matches look good”) to measurable performance indicators grounded in reproducible methodology.
</p>

<h3>Why Evaluation Matters in Sanctions Screening</h3>

<p>
Sanctions screening is inherently a risk management activity. A missed match may expose an institution to regulatory penalties, while excessive false positives can overwhelm investigation teams and degrade trust in the system.
</p>

<p>
Unlike many machine learning tasks, sanctions matching operates under asymmetric risk:
</p>

<ul>
<li>False negatives represent potential compliance failures</li>
<li>False positives represent operational burden</li>
</ul>

<p>
A meaningful evaluation framework must therefore quantify both error types and allow stakeholders to reason about trade-offs.
</p>

<p>
To simulate realistic screening conditions, our experiment compares entities from the sanctions lists published by the <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}</strong> and the <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</strong>. Cross-references from <strong>:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</strong> provide an external ground truth that allows objective classification of matches.
</p>

<h3>The Confusion Matrix as an Evaluation Model</h3>

<p>
The confusion matrix is the foundation of our evaluation framework. It categorizes predictions into four mutually exclusive outcomes:
</p>

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>Predicted Match</th><th>Predicted Non-Match</th></tr>
<tr><td>Actual Match</td><td>True Positive (TP)</td><td>False Negative (FN)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Actual Non-Match</td><td>False Positive (FP)</td><td>True Negative (TN)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
This structure allows us to translate matching decisions into measurable performance metrics.
</p>

<h3>Core Evaluation Metrics</h3>

<p>
From the confusion matrix, we derive the primary indicators used throughout this series:
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Precision</strong> — proportion of predicted matches that are correct</li>
<li><strong>Recall</strong> — proportion of true matches successfully identified</li>
<li><strong>F1 score</strong> — harmonic balance between precision and recall</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each metric highlights a different operational dimension:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Precision reflects alert quality and investigation efficiency</li>
<li>Recall reflects compliance coverage and risk containment</li>
<li>F1 score provides a balanced summary for comparison</li>
</ul>

<p>
Importantly, no single metric fully describes system behavior. Evaluation must be interpreted in context.
</p>

<h3>Threshold Sensitivity and Decision Trade-offs</h3>

<p>
Most matching systems produce a similarity score that must be compared against a decision threshold. Adjusting this threshold changes system behavior:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Lower thresholds increase recall but generate more false positives</li>
<li>Higher thresholds improve precision but risk missing true matches</li>
</ul>

<p>
This trade-off is not merely technical — it represents a governance decision involving compliance policy, operational capacity, and risk tolerance.
</p>

<p>
A robust evaluation framework therefore includes threshold analysis, allowing stakeholders to observe how performance metrics evolve under different decision boundaries.
</p>

<h3>Ground Truth and Experimental Validity</h3>

<p>
Evaluation is only meaningful when predictions are compared against reliable reference data. In this experiment, OpenSanctions cross-links act as an external validation layer indicating whether two records correspond to the same real-world entity.
</p>

<p>
This approach allows us to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Objectively classify matching outcomes</li>
<li>Measure error rates consistently</li>
<li>Reproduce results across experiments</li>
</ul>

<p>
While no ground truth is perfect, external validation ensures that performance claims are transparent and verifiable.
</p>

<h3>Operational Interpretation of Metrics</h3>

<p>
Metrics must ultimately be translated into operational meaning:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A recall increase may reduce regulatory risk but raise investigation workload</li>
<li>A precision improvement may streamline operations but require tighter thresholds</li>
<li>Balanced tuning reflects institutional priorities</li>
</ul>

<p>
Evaluation is therefore not just measurement — it is decision support for compliance engineering.
</p>

<h3>Preparing for Pipeline Comparison</h3>

<p>
With a consistent evaluation framework in place, we can now compare different matching paradigms on equal footing. Both the classical fuzzy pipeline and the embedding-based pipeline introduced in the previous article will be measured using the same confusion matrix methodology and threshold analysis.
</p>

<p>
This ensures that comparisons are grounded in observable behavior rather than subjective preference.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Evaluating sanctions matching systems requires more than aggregate accuracy claims. A structured framework based on confusion matrices, core metrics, and threshold analysis provides a transparent foundation for assessing performance under real compliance constraints.
</p>

<p>
In the next article, we apply this framework to a classical fuzzy matching pipeline and analyze its behavior in a controlled sanctions matching experiment.
