In a previous <a href="https://www.ejtorre.com/blog/post/main-international-sanctions-lists-data-sources/"
    title="Main international sanctions lists data sources" target="_blank">post</a>, I gathered the links to the main
sources of sanctions lists. In this post, I will go deeper about the available information, how
to read it (I will use a python module developed by me called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/inoutlists/"
    title="inoutlists" target="_blank">inoutlists</a>) and finally I will summarize the data of the three main sanctions
lists sources (UN, EU and OFAC).
